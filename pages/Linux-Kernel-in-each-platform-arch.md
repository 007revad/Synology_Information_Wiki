Any recently released Synology NAS that uses a CPU that Synology had not previously used use kernel 5.10, like the SA6400, DS124, DS423, DS223j and DS223.

Any Synology with the following CPU architectures use kernel 4.4
- apollolake, armada37xx, broadwell, broadwellnk, broadwellnkv2, broadwellntbap, denverton, geminilake, kvmcloud, kvmx64, purley, r1000, rtd1296 and v1000

Synology's with older CPU architectures use kernel 3.10
