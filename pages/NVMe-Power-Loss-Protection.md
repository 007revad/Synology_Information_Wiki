I believe you can't get NVMe drives with power loss protection in the 2280 size. You'd need 22110 M.2 drives with power loss protection... but all Synology NAS with built-in M.2 slots are 2280. And the only M.2 PCIe adaptor card that can take 22110 M.2 drives are the E10M20-T1 and M20D20.
If you have a reliable UPS, and you should, then you don't really need NVMe drives with power loss protection.
