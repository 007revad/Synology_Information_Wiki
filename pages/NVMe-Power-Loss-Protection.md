### NVMe drives with Power Loss Protection (PLP) in a Synology NAS

NVMe drives with power loss protection are more common in the 22110 size. But there are some 2280 size data center NVMe drives available: 
- Addlink D60 NAS SSD NVMe drives in 500GB, 1TB and 2TB https://www.addlink.com.tw/nas-d60
- Kingston DC1000B NVMe drives in 240GB and 480GB https://www.kingston.com/en/ssd/dc1000b-data-center-boot-ssd

All Synology NAS with built-in M.2 slots are 2280. 

The only M.2 PCIe adaptor card that can take 22110 M.2 drives are the E10M20-T1 and M20D20.

- **E10M20-T1** specs: https://www.synology.com/en-global/products/E10M20-T1#specs
- **M20D20** specs: https://www.synology.com/en-global/products/M2D20#specs
- M20D18 specs: https://www.synology.com/en-global/products/M2D20#specs

If you have a reliable UPS, and you should, then you don't really need NVMe drives with power loss protection.
