### NVMe drives with Power Loss Protection (PLP) in a Synology NAS

Apparrently NVMe drives with power loss protection only come in the 22110 size. But all Synology NAS with built-in M.2 slots are 2280. And the only M.2 PCIe adaptor card that can take 22110 M.2 drives are the E10M20-T1 and M20D20.

- **E10M20-T1** specs: https://www.synology.com/en-global/products/E10M20-T1#specs
- **M20D20** specs: https://www.synology.com/en-global/products/M2D20#specs
- M20D18 specs: https://www.synology.com/en-global/products/M2D20#specs

If you have a reliable UPS, and you should, then you don't really need NVMe drives with power loss protection.
