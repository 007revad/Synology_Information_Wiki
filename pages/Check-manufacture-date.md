You can tell by the serial number what year and month your Synology was manufactured.

The first 3 characters of the serial number are the manufactured YMD (pre-2020) or YYM (post 2020).

Examples from my Synology NAS:
```
C4K = 2012 Apr 20th   DS1812+
F8L = 2015 Aug 21st   DX213    (revision 2)
226 = 2022 Jun        DS720+   (revision 2)
20C = 2020 Dec        DS1821+
252 = 2025 Feb        DS925+
```

Convert character to year/date number
```

1 = 1
